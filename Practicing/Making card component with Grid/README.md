## Building Card Component with Grid

This time I built up the same card component I made with Flexbox, but with Grid.

Our target is to make the layout look like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Jplaudir8/Front-end-exercises/blob/master/Practicing/Making%20card%20component%20with%20Grid/Image-2.png" width="600" alt="" title="Color and Font Scheme">
</p>

But obviously, since CSS Grid does not work like that, those lines would mostly look like this under the hood:

</p>

</p>
